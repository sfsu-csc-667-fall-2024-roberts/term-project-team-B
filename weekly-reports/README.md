Weekly report materials, when required, will be submitted in sub-directories of this folder.


For the term project this week, We accomplished the following tasks:

Project Planning and Feature Identification:

Defined the core features of the Tank Game, including user authentication, lobby system, game modes, real-time chat, and gameplay mechanics.
Created a detailed list of both required features and specific game functionality (such as tank movement, shooting mechanics, power-ups, and score tracking).
Technology Stack Selection:

Identified the required technologies for the project (Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Render) and additional technologies such as Socket.IO for real-time communication and Gravatar API for player avatars.
Wireframe Design:

Designed low-fidelity wireframes for key screens of the Tank Game, including the login page, lobby screen, game screen, and profile management page. These wireframes helped visualize the layout and interactions for each part of the application.
User Interaction Documentation:

Documented how users will interact with the application across different screens, such as logging in, joining or creating games in the lobby, controlling tanks in the game, and managing their profiles.
