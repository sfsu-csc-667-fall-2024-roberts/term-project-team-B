## Summary

This week, with the guidance provided by the Milestone 4 PDF, we cleaned up the structure of our code and organized it for brevity and clarity. We also delegated the job of routing certain aspects of our game to their respective files (for example, `auth.ts` for all auth routes, `game.ts` for all game related routes, etc...). 

## Milestones for the Week

- [x] Fully implement auth routes
- [x] Implement the database connection
- [x] Implement login data verification
- [x] Fix issue preventing redirects from the login page
- [x] Implement the game logic
