3. Accomplishments for the Week:
This week, we followed the helpful instructions outlined in the PDF document attached to Milestone 2 and got skeleton code for our backend set up. At the time of writing (Mon 10/21), our team is planning on holding an in-person meeting and discussing our complete vision for this term project.

We focused on setting up the development environment for the project, which serves as the foundation for the backend system of the tank game. Key accomplishments include:

- We created the necessary directory structure for the backend and frontend, setting up clear separation for server-side and client-side code.
- Initialized the project as a Git repository and created an npm project with appropriate settings for collaboration among team members.
- A minimal Express server was implemented. 
- Integrated TypeScript into the project and created middleware to log the request time. (This middleware will be useful for debugging and monitoring.)
- Set up EJS as the templating engine for dynamic page rendering, where future game interfaces will be displayed. For example, a basic view was created to render a placeholder welcome page for the game.

4. Milestones Assigned for the Week

Team tasks:
[] Do we have a functional development environment?

[] Are the code and changes consistently tracked using Git? 
The repository is ready for pull requests, enabling team members to review each other's code.

[] Create an Express server capable of serving static files and handling basic routes, which will serve as the backbone for more complex game functionality later.

[] Add middleware for logging and initial error handling to ensure robust response management for both valid and invalid requests.

!!! Team remember to look for
1. backend capabilities
2. user authentication
3. multiplayer support
4. tank movement, combat, and real-time communications

6. Milestone 2 was completed.
